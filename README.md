# Tuix

Tuix is a mouse-oriented terminal user interface library built on [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) written in Go.
Tuix gives you a desktop and multi-window user experience in the terminal.

This project is experimental and is subject to change!

You can see it in action via ssh: ```ssh mouse-test@a.cmiller.me```
